# Optimize Data Pipelines for Better Performance in Azure Databricks

## Objective:
By the end of this lab, you will understand how to optimize data pipelines in Azure Databricks to improve performance. You will learn techniques for optimizing data ingestion, transformation, and storage.

## Sample Dataset:
For this lab, we will use a public dataset of New York City Taxi Trips, which contains detailed records of trips including pickup and dropoff times, locations, passenger counts, and fare amounts.

## Prerequisites:
- An Azure account with access to Databricks
- Basic knowledge of Spark and Databricks

## Step-by-Step Instructions:
### Step 1: Setting up Azure Databricks
1. Create an Azure Databricks Workspace:

- Go to the Azure portal.
- Search for "Databricks" and select "Azure Databricks".
- Click "Create" and follow the prompts to set up a new workspace.

2. Create a Databricks Cluster:

- In your Databricks workspace, navigate to "Clusters".
- Click "Create Cluster" and configure the cluster settings (e.g., cluster name, cluster mode, and instance type).
- Click "Create Cluster" to launch the cluster.

### Step 2: Importing the Dataset
1. Upload the Dataset to Databricks:

- In your Databricks workspace, go to "Data" > "Add Data".
- Click "Upload File" and select the yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet file.
- Follow the prompts to upload the file to DBFS (Databricks File System).

2. Load the Dataset into a DataFrame
```python
# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.parquet("/FileStore/tables/yellow_tripdata_2022-01.parquet")
```

### Step 3: Data Ingestion Optimization
1. Optimize Data Ingestion with Auto Loader:
- Auto Loader incrementally and efficiently processes new files as they arrive in a cloud storage container.

```python
df = (spark.readStream
        .format("cloudFiles")
        .option("cloudFiles.format", "parquet")
        .load("/mnt/data/nyc_taxi_trips/"))

df.writeStream.format("delta").option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/data/nyc_taxi_trips/checkpoints").start("/mnt/delta/nyc_taxi_trips")
```

### Step 4: Data Transformation Optimization

1. Use Delta Lake for Better Performance:
- Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing.

```python
    df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/delta/nyc_taxi_trips")
```

2. Optimize Data Skew with Salting:
- Data skew can lead to uneven task distribution. Salting helps distribute data more evenly across partitions.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, rand

# Add a salt column
df_salted = df.withColumn("salt", (rand() * 100).cast("int"))

# Repartition based on the salted column
df_salted.repartition("salt").write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/delta/nyc_taxi_trips_salted")
```

### Step 5 - Storage Optimization

1. Optimize Delta Table:
- Use Delta Lake's optimization commands to improve read performance.

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/mnt/delta/nyc_taxi_trips")
delta_table.optimize().executeCompaction()
```

2. Z-Order Clustering
- Z-Order clustering co-locates related information in the same set of files, improving query performance.

```python
    delta_table.optimize().executeZOrderBy("pickup_datetime")
```

### Step 6 - Monitoring and Managing Pipelines

1. Monitor Job Performance
- Use Databricks' job monitoring tools to analyze and optimize the performance of your data pipelines.

```python
    # Example of starting a job and monitoring
    dbutils.notebook.run("/path/to/notebook", timeout_seconds=3600)
```

2. Tune Spark Configurations
- Adjust Spark configurations based on the workload and cluster capabilities for optimal performance.

```python
    spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200)
    spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.io.cache.enabled", "true")
```

By following these steps, you have learned how to optimize data pipelines in Azure Databricks for better performance. The techniques covered include data ingestion optimization, transformation optimization, and storage optimization using Delta Lake, Auto Loader, and Spark configurations.
