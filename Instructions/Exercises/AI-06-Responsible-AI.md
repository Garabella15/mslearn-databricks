# Exercise 06 - Responsible AI with Large Language Models using Azure Databricks and GPT-4

## Objective
In this exercise, you will learn how to implement responsible AI practices when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 using Azure Databricks. The focus will be on understanding and mitigating risks, such as bias, fairness, and hallucinations, and ensuring transparency and accountability in AI models.

## Requirements
An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Step 1: Provision Azure Databricks
- Login to Azure Portal
    1. Go to Azure Portal and sign in with your credentials.
- Create Databricks Service:
    1. Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Analytics" > "Azure Databricks".
    2. Enter the necessary details like workspace name, subscription, resource group (create new or select existing), and location.
    3. Select the pricing tier (choose standard for this lab).
    4. Click "Review + create" and then "Create" once validation passes.

## Step 2: Launch Workspace and Create a Cluster
- Launch Databricks Workspace
    1. Once the deployment is complete, go to the resource and click "Launch Workspace".
- Create a Spark Cluster:
    1. In the Databricks workspace, click "Compute" on the sidebar, then "Create compute".
    2. Specify the cluster name and select a runtime version of Spark.
    3. Choose the Worker type as "Standard" and node type based on available options (choose smaller nodes for cost-efficiency).
    4. Click "Create compute".

## Step 3: Set Up Azure OpenAI Service
- Create an Azure OpenAI Resource
    1. Go to the Azure portal and search for "Azure OpenAI."
    2. Click "Create" and provide necessary details like resource name, region, and pricing tier.

- Get API Keys:
    1. After the resource is created, navigate to it and locate the API keys under "Keys and Endpoint."
    2. Copy the endpoint URL and one of the keys for later use.

## Step 4: Integrate GPT-4 with Azure Databricks
- Install Required Libraries
    1. In the Databricks workspace, create a new notebook.
    2. Install necessary Python libraries using the following commands:

    ```python
    %pip install openai
    ```
- Configure API Connection
    1. In the notebook, set up the connection to the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 model using the API key and endpoint.

    ```python
    import openai

    openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    openai.api_base = "YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"
    ```

- Test GPT-4 Integration:
    1. Run a simple query to verify the integration:

    ```python
    response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="gpt-4",
    prompt="What is responsible AI?",
    max_tokens=100
    )

    print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
    ```

## Step 5: Implement Responsible AI Practices
- Bias Detection and Mitigation
    1. Create a notebook cell to test for potential biases in the GPT-4 model's responses. For example, you can prompt the model with neutral and loaded questions, comparing the outputs.

    2. Implement strategies for bias mitigation, such as prompt engineering and post-processing of model outputs.

    ```python
    neutral_prompt = "Describe a leader."
    loaded_prompt = "Describe a female leader."

    neutral_response = openai.Completion.create(engine="gpt-4", prompt=neutral_prompt, max_tokens=100)
    loaded_response = openai.Completion.create(engine="gpt-4", prompt=loaded_prompt, max_tokens=100)

    print("Neutral Response:", neutral_response.choices[0].text.strip())
    print("Loaded Response:", loaded_response.choices[0].text.strip())
    ```

- Fairness and Transparency

    1. Create logging mechanisms to track and explain the decisions made by the model.
    2. Implement a method to interpret and explain the outputs, such as through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or other interpretability tools.

    ```python
    # Example: Log model outputs for later analysis
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(filename='gpt4_outputs.log', level=logging.INFO)

    logging.info("Neutral Prompt Response: " + neutral_response.choices[0].text.strip())
    logging.info("Loaded Prompt Response: " + loaded_response.choices[0].text.strip())
    ```

- Hallucination Detection

    1. Analyze outputs to detect hallucinations (i.e., when the model generates incorrect or nonsensical information).
    2. Implement validation checks by cross-referencing with external reliable sources.

    ```python
    prompt = "Give a detailed history of the event that never happened."
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="gpt-4", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=200)

    print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
    # Cross-reference with trusted data sources to validate the information
    ```

## Step 6: Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

- Model Evaluation
    1. Evaluate the model's performance on key metrics like fairness, accuracy, and relevance.
    2. Create custom evaluation metrics if needed, focusing on responsible AI aspects.

- Continuous Monitoring
    1. Set up dashboards in Databricks to monitor the model's behavior over time.
    2. Implement alerts for any deviations from expected behavior that could indicate bias, hallucinations, or other issues.

    ```python
    # Example: Plotting response times or biases over time
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Sample data
    times = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    biases = [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1]

    plt.plot(times, biases)
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Bias Score')
    plt.title('Bias Over Time')
    plt.show()
    ```

## Step 7: Reporting and Documentation
- Create Responsible AI Documentation
    1. Document the steps taken to ensure responsible AI in your project, including any bias mitigation strategies, fairness assessments, and transparency mechanisms.

- Prepare a Summary Report
    1. Summarize the findings, including the effectiveness of the responsible AI strategies implemented.
    2. Provide recommendations for further improvements.

## Step 8: Clean Up Resources
- Terminate the Cluster:
    1. Go back to the "Compute" page, select your cluster, and click "Terminate" to stop the cluster.

- Optional: Delete the Databricks Service:
    1. To avoid incurring further charges, consider deleting the Databricks workspace if this lab is not part of a larger project or learning path.

By completing this exercise, you have successfully implemented responsible AI practices in developing and deploying Large Language Models using Azure Databricks and GPT-4. These practices will help you build AI systems that are fair, transparent, and aligned with ethical guidelines.
