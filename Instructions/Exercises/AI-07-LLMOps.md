# Exercise 07 - Implementing LLMOps with Azure Databricks

## Objective
This exercise will guide you through the process of implementing Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps) using Azure Databricks. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to manage, deploy, and monitor large language models (LLMs) in a production environment using best practices.

## Requirements
An active Azure subscription. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Step 1: Provision Azure Databricks
- Login to Azure Portal
    1. Go to Azure Portal and sign in with your credentials.
- Create Databricks Service:
    1. Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Analytics" > "Azure Databricks".
    2. Enter the necessary details like workspace name, subscription, resource group (create new or select existing), and location.
    3. Select the pricing tier (choose standard for this lab).
    4. Click "Review + create" and then "Create" once validation passes.

## Step 2: Launch Workspace and Create a Cluster
- Launch Databricks Workspace
    1. Once the deployment is complete, go to the resource and click "Launch Workspace".
- Create a Spark Cluster:
    1. In the Databricks workspace, click "Compute" on the sidebar, then "Create compute".
    2. Specify the cluster name and select a runtime version of Spark.
    3. Choose the Worker type as "Standard" and node type based on available options (choose smaller nodes for cost-efficiency).
    4. Click "Create compute".

- Install Necessary Libraries
    1. Once your cluster is running, navigate to the "Libraries" tab.
    2. Install the following libraries:
        - azure-ai-openai (for connecting to Azure OpenAI)
        - mlflow (for model management)
        - scikit-learn (for additional model evaluation if needed)

## Step 3: Model Management
- Upload or Access the LLM
    1. If you have a trained model, upload it to your Databricks File System (DBFS) or use Azure OpenAI to access a pretrained model.
    2. If using Azure OpenAI

    ```python
    from azure.ai.openai import OpenAIClient

    client = OpenAIClient(api_key="<Your_API_Key>")
    model = client.get_model("gpt-3.5-turbo")

    ```
- Versioning the Model using MLflow
    1. Initialize MLflow tracking

    ```python
    import mlflow

    mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")
    mlflow.start_run()
    ```

- Log the Model

```python
mlflow.pyfunc.log_model("model", python_model=model)
mlflow.end_run()

```

## Step 4: Model Deployment
- Create a REST API for the Model
    1. Create a Databricks notebook for your API.
    2. Define the API endpoints using Flask or FastAPI

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    import mlflow.pyfunc

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        data = request.json
        model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("model")
        prediction = model.predict(data["input"])
        return jsonify(prediction)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
    ```
- Save and run this notebook to start the API.

## Step 5: Model Monitoring
- Set up Logging and Monitoring using MLflow
    1. Enable MLflow autologging in your notebook

    ```python
    mlflow.autolog()
    ```

    2. Track predictions and input data.

    ```python
    mlflow.log_param("input", data["input"])
    mlflow.log_metric("prediction", prediction)
    ```

- Implement Alerts for Model Drift or Performance Issues
    1. Use Azure Databricks or Azure Monitor to set up alerts for significant changes in model performance.

## Step 6: Model Retraining and Automation
- Set up Automated Retraining Pipelines
    1. Create a new Databricks notebook for retraining.
    2. Schedule the retraining job using Databricks Jobs or Azure Data Factory.
    3. Automate the retraining process based on data drift or time intervals.

- Deploy the Retrained Model Automatically
    1. Use MLflowâ€™s model_registry to update the deployed model automatically.
    2. Deploy the retrained model using the same process as in Step 3.

## Step 7: Responsible AI Practices
- Integrate Bias Detection and Mitigation
    1. Use Azure's Fairlearn or custom scripts to assess model bias.
    2. Implement mitigation strategies and log the results using MLflow.

- Implement Ethical Guidelines for LLM Deployment
    1. Ensure transparency in model predictions by logging input data and predictions.
    2. Establish guidelines for model usage and ensure compliance with ethical standards.

This exercise provided a comprehensive guide to implementing LLMOps with Azure Databricks, covering model management, deployment, monitoring, retraining, and responsible AI practices. Following these steps will help you manage and operate LLMs efficiently in a production environment.
