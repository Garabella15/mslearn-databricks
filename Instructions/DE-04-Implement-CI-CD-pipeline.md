# Implement CI/CD Pipelines with Azure Databricks and Azure DevOps or Azure Databricks and GitHub

## Objective:
To implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub, integrating with Azure Databricks to automate the deployment of data engineering solutions.

## Prerequisites:
- An active Azure subscription.
- Access to Azure DevOps.
- A GitHub account.
- Basic knowledge of Azure Databricks, Azure DevOps, and GitHub.

## Sample Dataset:
We'll use a simple CSV dataset containing sales data. The dataset has the following columns:

- Date: The date of the transaction.
- Product: The product name.
- Quantity: The quantity sold.
- Price: The price of the product.

```sql
Date,Product,Quantity,Price
2024-01-01,ProductA,10,100
2024-01-02,ProductB,5,150
2024-01-03,ProductC,8,200
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
#### Step 1: Set Up Azure Databricks
1. Create an Azure Databricks workspace:

- Go to the Azure portal.
- Click on "Create a resource" and search for "Azure Databricks".
- Create a new Databricks workspace in your desired resource group and region.

2. Create a cluster:

- Navigate to your Databricks workspace.
- Go to the "Clusters" section and create a new cluster with the default settings.

3. Upload the dataset:

- Once the cluster is running, go to the "Workspace" section.
- Create a new notebook and attach it to your cluster.
- Upload the sample CSV file to the Databricks File System (DBFS).

#### Step 2: Set Up a GitHub Repository
1. Create a new GitHub repository:
- Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.

2. Clone the repository:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

3. Add the sample dataset:
- Add the sample CSV file to your repository and commit the changes.

4. Create a basic Databricks notebook:
- Create a new notebook in your repository with some basic data processing code, such as reading the CSV file and performing some transformations.

#### Step 3: Set Up Azure DevOps
1. Create an Azure DevOps project:
- Go to the Azure DevOps portal and create a new project.

2. Connect Azure DevOps to GitHub:
- In your Azure DevOps project, go to the "Repos" section and connect it to your GitHub repository.

3. Create a Service Connection:

- In Azure DevOps, navigate to "Project settings" > "Service connections".
- Create a new service connection for Azure, granting access to your Databricks workspace.

#### Step 4: Configure CI Pipeline in Azure DevOps
1. Create a new pipeline:

- In your Azure DevOps project, go to the "Pipelines" section and create a new pipeline.
- Choose "GitHub" as the source and select your repository.

2. Define the CI pipeline:

- Use the following YAML configuration for the CI pipeline:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: UsePythonVersion@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '3.x'
    addToPath: true

- script: |
    pip install databricks-cli
  displayName: 'Install Databricks CLI'

- script: |
    databricks fs cp dbfs:/FileStore/sample_sales.csv .
  displayName: 'Download Sample Data from DBFS'

- script: |
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
  displayName: 'Run Unit Tests'
```

#### Step 5: Configure CD Pipeline in Azure DevOps
1. Create a new release pipeline:
- In your Azure DevOps project, go to the "Pipelines" > "Releases" section and create a new release pipeline.

2. Add an artifact:
- Select your build pipeline as the artifact source.

3. Define the CD pipeline:
- Add a stage and configure the tasks to deploy to Azure Databricks.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: DeployToDatabricks
    pool:
      vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: UsePythonVersion@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '3.x'
        addToPath: true

    - script: |
        pip install databricks-cli
      displayName: 'Install Databricks CLI'

    - script: |
        databricks workspace import_dir /path/to/notebooks /Workspace/Notebooks
      displayName: 'Deploy Notebooks to Databricks'
```

#### Step 6: Run the Pipelines
1. Commit and push changes:

- Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

2. Trigger the CI pipeline:

- The CI pipeline will automatically run when changes are pushed to the repository.
- Verify that the CI pipeline completes successfully.

3. Trigger the CD pipeline:

- Create a new release in the release pipeline and deploy the notebooks to Databricks.
- Verify that the notebooks are deployed and executed successfully in your Databricks workspace.

### Conclusion
You've successfully set up CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub, integrating with Azure Databricks to automate the deployment of your data engineering solutions. This lab provides a foundational understanding of how to leverage these tools to streamline your development and deployment processes.
